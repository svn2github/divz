This only applies to Windows builds. 

This folder, 'runtime', contains the DLLs that need to be copied into the output folder where dviz.exe or dviz-viewer.exe is placed inorder for the dviz*.exe to be run in Qt Creator.

If you want to run dviz.exe outside of Qt creator, you will also need to copy the proper Qt*.dll's into place as well.
