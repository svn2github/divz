Update GLDrawable to either support:
	- Blue Alpha Blending
		- Already supports alpha masks
		- Use the blue channel (or some other channel) to control blending the pixel between BLACK and the texture color
		- This would allow drawing black lines on top of the texture using the alpha mask, instead of requiring a third texture for an overlay (in addition to the alpha mask)
	- Or a third texture for overlay on top of the alpha mask
		
Update VideoThread to support HD
	Need to create a variable length buffer
	Move timing code into buffer control
	Selectivly hold frames if falling behind 
	
	Also, get YUV420P working in raw format to allow YUV conversion on the GPU
