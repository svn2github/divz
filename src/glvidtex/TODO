Target: pixelrevo-player
	Components:
		Core:
			GLWidget / GLDrawable
				Drawable Items:
					GLVideoInputDrawable
					GLVideoFileDrawable
					GLVideoReceiverDrawable
					GLImageDrawable (done)
					GLTextDrawable
					GLRectDrawable
				Todo Items:
					- Add native cross fading support in GLVideoDrawable (since all items above will probably derive from GLVideoDrawable)
					- Add a 'transmit video' property to Video(input|file) drawables
					- Add dropshadow support for image/text/rect
					- Add outline support for image/text/rect/videos
					- Add (explicit?) property animations for GLDrawable rect/opac props
					- Consider adding a GLWebDrawable .. ? (idea: Use the proxy method used in DViz to render using QWebView off screen and feed frames as a video source...?)
		Playing Functionality:
			- Two things to 'play':
				- inputs for the drawables (videos/images/etc)
				- the entire layout
					- Structure Concept:
						- Scene
							- All the elements as a bulk collection
							- Layout
								- Positions elements, shows/hides elements
			- Need a controller which:
				- loads playlists for each item and for layout
				- syncs changes to clock
				- listens for changes to playlist object and reloads accordingly
				
			- Need playlist object:
				- list of playlist items
					- item:
						- drawableId & propName/value
						- 
						
			
					





Update GLDrawable to either support:
	- Blue Alpha Blending
		- Already supports alpha masks
		- Use the blue channel (or some other channel) to control blending the pixel between BLACK and the texture color
		- This would allow drawing black lines on top of the texture using the alpha mask, instead of requiring a third texture for an overlay (in addition to the alpha mask)
	- Or a third texture for overlay on top of the alpha mask
		
Update VideoThread to support HD
	Need to create a variable length buffer
	Move timing code into buffer control
	Selectivly hold frames if falling behind 
	
	Also, get YUV420P working in raw format to allow YUV conversion on the GPU
