ALPHA
DATE
SHORTINT
LONGINT
CURRENCY
NUMBER
LOGICAL
TIMESTAMP
MEMOBLOB

the rest is currenly not supported. mail me if you need more.

Problems
========

Y2K
---
Paradox-files are NOT Y2K-safe. Currently there is a workarund for this bug
in pxconvert.c that adds 100 years if the date is before 1.1.1970.

Index-files
-----------
The information you get out of the index-files by pxsqldump is not rellay
usefull. It all the data it can find, but the header is currently parsed
wrong. Anyway these index-files are not needed to convert a paradox-database
into a SQL-database. (PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY can't be detected yet.)

TIMESTAMP
---------
The field-type TIMESTAMP returned by pxsqldump has a precission of 
+/- 1 second.
