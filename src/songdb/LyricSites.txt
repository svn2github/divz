	<ol><li class="first">Like a river glorious is God&#8217;s perfect peace,<br />Over all victorious, in its bright increase;<br />Perfect, yet it floweth fuller every day,<br />Perfect, yet it groweth deeper all the way.
	<ul><li class="refrain"><span class="refrain">Refrain:</span><br />Stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blest<br />Finding, as He promised, perfect peace and rest.</li></ul></li>

	<li>Hidden in the hollow of His blessed hand,<br />Never foe can follow, never traitor stand;<br />Not a surge of worry, not a shade of care,<br />Not a blast of hurry touch the spirit there.</li>
	<li>Every joy or trial falleth from above,<br />Traced upon our dial by the Sun of Love;<br />We may trust Him fully all for us to do;<br />They who trust Him wholly find Him wholly true.</li>
