Theory:
	Basic graphics engine of LiveMix is the GLWidget
		GLWidget can have various GLDrawables
			Example: GLVideoDrawable renders a video stream using OpenGL
		Drawables can be:
			- anywhere on the GLWidget
			- have opacity and a suggested bounding rectangle
			- Z order
			- In and Out animations
	
	LiveLayer has:
		A GLDrawable object to render on a GLWidget
		A Control Widget for controlling
		Many layers can be "live" at any one time
	
	LiveScene has:
		Many layers
		Timeline for showing/hiding/setting properties on layers
			Events on timeline can be:
				- Triggered automatically by the play clock
					- Clock starts when layer is "shown"
					- Clock pauses when it hits a non-timed trigger
				- Triggered manually by clicking on the trigger
		Only one scene "live" at any one time
		
	Document:
		Many scenes
			Scenes can be scheduled to Wall Clock time or to Play clock time
