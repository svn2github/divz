Picasa Strengths:
	- Contrast, Tuning, Blemish, Crop, and Rotation Tools
	- Display folder list as thumbnails - resizable
	- Export folder or selection 
	- Quick filter by stars
	- Collage tool
	- Export as HTML tool
	- Context strips when viewing individual image
	- Slideshow feature

Picasa Weaknesses:
	- No subfolder support
	- On linux, filesystem browsing freezes program (e.g. cannot change root of where imported folders are stored)
	- "Star" attribute is stored in an .ini file in the import folder
	- Images are "imported" into Picasa, and copied on-disk from current location to new location (no support for in-place folder browsing)
		- This allows Picasa to hide thumnail generation in the import code
