Batch Processing Tool
	Display each photo in a batch
	Assign: Rating, Tag(s), batch title (one batch may actually be many batches), Subject names
	Assignment should be as quick as possible
		as few key strokes as possible
		ideally NO mouse needed
		remember previous values for fields where possible/logical (not rating)
	Flag for dicarding
		"Delete me" flag
		
	For each photo, also process automatically:
		Assign UUID (uuidgen)
		Resize to 1024x768 and 64x64 (configurable)
		Store datums (above) with uuid into an sqlite database
		Other Ideas:
			Create a color key (divide by third lines, analyze for top X colors in each region)
			Create a softness rating (how soft/smooth/harsh is the photo)
			
	
Batch Query Tool
	Purpose: List/browse photos with minimum of distractions and as quickly as possible
		Photos reside in arbirtrary folder structure
		May/may not have been processed with batch processing tool
			May need a way to list which photos may "need processing" (e.g. fields null?)
			If photos dont have uuid, then thats dead giveaway
	
		Display modes:
			Massive flat list
				No filesystem folders
			Timeline of batches found
			Timeline of all photos (timeline should be zoomable)
			Group by batches
			Filter by ratings
			Search by tags
			
		Actions on list:
			Export list to folder/zip/tar etc
			Generate resized photos from list
