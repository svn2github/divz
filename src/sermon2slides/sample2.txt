He Is Lord

 

 

At the Triumphal Entry the crows embraced Jesus as Lord!

 

 

1.    He is Lord of Creation

 

                He made everything there is.

 

                        BIBLE: Colossians 1:15-16

 

 

2.    The is Lord of Heaven and Earth

 

                He rules everything right now

 

                        BIBLE: Hebrews 1:3; Col 1:17

 

 

3.    He is Lord of You and Me

 

                Don’t think of this as a negative.   The disciples of Jesus didn’t. 

 

NOTE: Lord meant he was in control…

 

·         Of their problems

·         Of their future

·         Of their Faith-Life
