Jesus as They Saw Him

 

What is in a name?  A lot I think.  Have you ever heard the expressions, “His name is mud!”?  What we call those we love tells a lot about what we think of them.

 

Today—Palm Sunday—as we consider the presentation of Jesus to the Jews,   I want us to consider the days, months and years before that day.  I want us to listen to the friends and disciples (and even a few enemies) of Jesus as they interact with Him during His days on earth. 

 

What did they think of Him?  We can tell a lot by the terms they use when they speak to Him.

 

Tonight I want us to look at five of these terms or expressions that folks who knew and loved Jesus used.

 

 

1.    Master (Jesus has the Right to Rule)

 

                BIBLE: Luke 5:5; Luke 8:24

 

                NOTE: The expression means “overseer” of “one who is in

                          charge” or “foreman”

 

                APPLY: When the disciples or others spoke like this, they were

                          acknowledging Jesus right to be the ruler of their lives!

 

               

2.    Lord (Jesus has the Power to Rule)

 

                EXPLAIN: The word means, “Supreme controller”, or “one who is

                              over all”

 

NOTE: “Master” may have more to do with his oversight,

          while “Lord” may have more to do with His power.

 

                                BIBLE: Matthew 8:2; 8:25; 14:28-30; 17:15

 

                APPLY: Here the disciples were saying, Jesus, you are over all in

my life—you have not just the right, but also the power to rule me.

 

 

3.    Son of David (Jesus is God’s Choice to Rule)

 

                BIBLE: Matthew 9:27; 12:23; 15:22; 20:30

 

                        NOTE: This is a term that is similar to “Messiah” or                                           “Christ”

 

                                BIBLE: Matt. 12:23; 21:9; 21:15…compare 16:16

 

QUEST: What about the term, “Son of Man”?  This was used by

Jesus of Himself, not by others about Him.  This is primarily an eschatological term referring to the future return of Messiah.

 

                        NOTE: Another term in the same vein used of Jesus was

                                  “the prophet”

 

                                BIBLE: Matthew 21:11; compare Deut. 18:15-17

 

                APPLY: Here the disciples and friends of Jesus had in mind the

fact that Jesus was the Long-awaited Ruler, the one God had promised – God’s choice to rule.

 

 

4.    Son of God (Jesus is God’s Presence to Rule)

 

                BIBLE: Matthew 14:33; John 11:27

 

                NOTE: This is a term that refers to Jesus’ divine nature and the

                         power and authority that flow from it.

 

                        BIBLE: Mark 3:11

 

                        ILLUS: Two brothers are arguing.  To win the argument

one says, “But mom said….”  The other boy says, “No she didn’t!”  Then both boys hear mom who is just outside the door saying, “Yes I did!”

 

It is one thing to speak mom’s words, but still another for mom to speak her words!

 

 

 

                APPLY: The point here is that Jesus is no mere man; no mere

human.  He is the Christ, the Son of the Living God (Matthew 16:16).

 

This means that to His disciples, Jesus comes as a divine presence—God in person—to rule their lives.

 

 

5.    Teacher (Jesus has Divine Insight to Rule)

 

                NOTE: This expression is most often used by Jesus’ enemies in a

derogative way  (Matthew 8:19; 22:16; 22:23; 22:36; 26:49 (Judas);

 

                EXPLAIN: But when the disciples use the expression, it relates to

the wisdom or insight Jesus has.  These people are saying, “Jesus, you have the wisdom to rule my life.”

 

                        BIBLE: Mark 4:38; 9:17; 9:38; 10:17; 13:1

                                  Luke 3:12

                                        John 8:4

 

                ILLUS: We have all had bossed where we wondered how did they

                          ever become boss—they don’t have a clue!

 

                APPLY: But Jesus is a different kind of boss—a different kind of

rulers in our lives.  He has the divine insight to rule our lives.
