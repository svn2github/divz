Revised Task list for Release 1.0, 10/18/09:
	----------------------------
	"Tasty Breakfast" Release
	----------------------------
	Target Use Cases: 
	Songs, Announcements, Sermon
	----------------------------
	
	- Models:
		[DONE] - Song Database Model
			[DONE] - SQLite Backend 
	- Logic:
		[DONE] - Translator/Slide Generator
			[DONE] - Given a Song, translate into a slide group
	- UI:
		[DONE] - List of forms needed:
			[DONE] - "Grid and Guidelines" Form
			[DONE] - Slide Group settings (aspect ratio, etc)
				[LATER] aspect ratio per slide
			[DONE] - Song Editor
		[DONE] - SongDatabase List View
			- One column
			#- Three columns:
			#	- Title, #, Tags (Chorus, Hymn, etc)
		[DONE] - Search Function:
			[NOT IMPL] - Default to Full Text, Sort by Title
				- only implemented title search, but can match any part of title and can use wildcards
			#- Title
			#- Name
			#- Full Text
		[DONE] - Random access viewer control
			[DONE] - Just do it
			[DONE] - Should be "smart" - for songs, render differently than generic slide groups
			[DONE] - Go by Group Type?
		[POSSIBLY LATER] - In-flight edits
			- need to add specific framework for this
	- Visuals:
		[DONE] - Add Aspect Ratio setting
		[DONE] - Text Centering in a Text Box
		[DONE] - Cross Fade on Changing Slide
			[DONE] - Important Point:
				[DONE] - Need to abstract video source/decoder to a "singleton" 
				[DONE] - Once source/decoder for that file per program
			[DONE] - When slide*Group* is set on scene, need to scan and initalize decoders for all videos, but STOP at first frame
			[DONE] - When cross fade starts, start playing
			[DONE] - Stop playing prev slide when cross fade ends
			[DONE] - Dont Release provider unless slide group is taken off scene?
		[DONE] - Shadows (Text):
			[DONE] - Can settle for simple block shadow
			[LATER] - Gausian blur if we have time 
		[DONE] - Backgrounds:
			[DONE] - Add background item type & Position automatically, Disable movement
			[DONE] - Still cant set item color/props with config box
		[DONE] - Undo/redo framework
			- Must have this for sermons and announcment slides
		[DONE] - Snap to grid support
		[DONE] - Increse/decrease size of font from toolbar - needed for sermon/announcment
		[DONE] - Copy/paste or duplicate slides
		[DONE] - Image Item
		[DONE] - SVG Item if we have time
			internal to image item
		[DONE] - Layout asissts - center objects vert/horz
			- need hint for this (e.g. songs) to auto adjust - maybe?
			- should be easy - have toolbar, just add actions and a slot, do calcs, set position
		[LATER] - Gradients - can settle for making gradients in gimp and import as photo, but need to eventually have support direclty in dviz
		
	
	- Improvements:
		
		[STARTED] When searching for song, auto select first result
			setCurrentIndex() doesnt seem to be working
		[STARTED] Crop handles should be easy - as move left in, move X out. Basically keep the image rect the same (or add negative offsets)
			not as easy as it looks!
			
		= Main UI =
			Add video pallette
			Add image palette
			Add slide pallette
			Add song template palette
			Add drag/drop background for songs from a yet-to-be-made vid/image bg pallette
		
		= Editor / Visual =
			Integrated grid dialog into slideeditor window
			Add rounded rectangle item / or round boxcontent corners
			move/add item config to a dock widget
			add animation to image items
			selection panel
		
		= Songs =
			Save song templates/bg in a "template collection"
			[STARTED] Need song new/edit/delete functionality
			Auto-sizing song text should be an option that can be enabled/disabled
				if not autosize, pull size from template / textobx
			option of font family should be available for song
				should it pull from textbox?
				should be easy to extract using text cursor - see model/TextItem.cpp - findFontsize() method
			Need to have a reset template button
			Need to add drag-drop from song list to song group
		
		= Outputs =
			Prompt to save custom output location on close
			Add outputview objects to encapsulate slidegroupviewer or network client/server
			On first start, intelligently detect aspect ratio of primary output - if no primary out, create small custom rect in top right
		
		= Misc = 
			Global cache pixmaps of doc/slide lists 
			Consider moving opengl option to a per-output setting
			Consider making Output objects QObjects that can emit signals when changed
		
			Move dialogs into their own subfolder in the source tree
			Move qt color dialog into 3rdparty
			Add color theme support vis a vi powerpoint
			Adapt genericitemconfig dialog to work on model item only without having to use the visual delegate

			add next/prev btns to preview widget
			add a "zero offset" shadow preset btn
			add test alignment (left/right/center) to toolbar
			
			is there a way to make the live output not show up in task list???
					see http://lists.trolltech.com/qt-interest/2007-07/thread00362-0.html for discussion on the opposite problem
			
			fonts in the program settings dialog still are incongruant sizes between all boxes
			
			when pressing f5 to go live in editor, should prompt if you want to enable auto change timer for this slide or not
			
			future: investigate midi area with auto aranging/tiling of windows
			
			when editor going to new slide and only one item in slide, select that item
			
			make selection in editor "smarter" 
				maybe by implementing better shapes for items
				e.g. convert text to painter path somehow and return as shape...maybe...
				
			offer "advanced" text item (restore old text layout code) that can do advanced font letter spacing, etc
				or maybe there is someway to adjust letter spacing in Qt's code?
			
			in editor, make PGUP/PGDOWN change slides
			
			add pixmap cache size option to program settings dialog
			add crossfade speed and quality options to program settings dialog
			
			make font size buttons use different algorithim for sizing fonts
				e.g. < 22, inc by 2
				from 22-44, inc by 4
				44-80, inc by 6
				8-100, inc by 8
				100-130, inc by 10
				130>, inc by 25??
				or some form of exponential, rounded percentage inc? (e.g. (int)(cur size * 1.5)) ?
			
		[DONE] pressing f2 in slide editor when focus in slide list should open slide prop dialog box
		[DONE] when pressing F2 and group is live, should start editor on lvie slide
		
		[DONE] add btn to slide timeout button for zero and for "guess"
		[DONE] auto focus slide timeout box in slide prop dialog
			
		[ON HOLD] intelligent merge (optimize) cross fades by comparing items from two slides and if none changed, then dont cross fade those items
			on hold because:
				- image backgrounds fade correctly (appear static) when duplicated - not sure how or why, but it looks find for now
					- it was with videos that it appears in correct, and we can probably hack it to look okay with videos without full merge support
				- on hold also because the algorithm, though it looks correct, was not achieving desired effect and I've put 2 hours into this already (more than its worth right now)
		
		[DONE] add black and clear buttons to song view control
			clear only shows background - so it works with any group type, as does fade to black
				
		[DONE] spacebar should change song slides
		[DONE] go-live should set focus to list view
			
		[DONE] integrate image functionality to background items
			
		[DONE] path in titlebar should only be file, not abs path
		[DONE] make keyboard movements snap to half-grid points
			harder than I thought, because kbd is done in mygraphicsscene, but snapping is done in abstract content
			need to set a flag maybe?
			this was finished back in r215(?) or somewhere in the last 5-10 revs, just forgot to mark it done
		
		[DONE] start video browser on using last video path - same for images
			remember across runs using AppSettings
			added AppSettings::previousPath() and related settor
			integrated functionality into GenericItemConfig
		
		[DONE] add seperator in mainwindow before trash group
		[DONE] set tooltip of toolbar icons in main and editor to include shortuct text (Ctrl+X or whatever)
			
		[DONE] Turn timer red when < 3 seconds (3...2...1)
		[DONE] Make timer label bold & larger

		[DONE] dialog titles on slide/group dialogs
		[DONE] show timeout as second line in slide list model
		[DONE] rename 2nd option in group dialog from "do nothing" to "loop"
		[DONE] move group options button further to right in editor		
		[DONE] add key accelerators to slide group options dialog
		[DONE] Auto-change slides/slide groups after X seconds
			added field in Slide.h, now to make SlideGroupViewer and UI honor the field (and SlideGroup::autoChangeGroup() flag in MainWindow)
		[DONE] add "sourceRect" attribute to visual item and delegates 
		[DONE] collapse <rect> and <pos> elements in the xml to use attributes rather than child elements
		[DONE] Need to add keyboard nudging/movement of items
		[DONE] Default shadow text should be black
		[DONE] right-click on slide list in editor to open slide config (incl'd bg config tab or btn to config bg)
			props like time to automatically switch slides, etc
			added toolbar item for it
		[DONE] in songeditor, be able to hit ESC to close
			- ALT+C instead
		[DONE] default background color should be gray or something "nicer" than black
			still start out live as black though
		[DONE] in editor, implement F5 (or similar key) to change Live to this group (if needed) and set this slide as current
		[DONE] Gausian blur shadows (start impl using QGraphicsEffects from 4.6, but performance is terrible, so I'll have to do some heavy optimizations before we can use it.)
			Implemented basic blur using code from qpixmapfilters.cpp, integrated into dviz in ImageFilters.cpp
			First implementation in TextBoxContent.cpp, included with very aggressive caching via QPixmapCache
			Started implementation in BoxContent.cpp, but paused to work on other features.
			Finished implementation and fixed issues in box content.
		[DONE] Set Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+shift+z as undo/redo shortcuts
		[DPNE] Set default font size on new text items larger than 16pt
		[DONE] Add appros icons to slide editor window and mainwidnow
		[DONE] Close undostack or integrate as a dock into slideeditor
		[DONE] Change SlideEditor in SlideGroupFactory.h to inherit from QMainWindow, then change songeeditor to just set a central widget
		[DONE] When searching for song and press enter in text field, auto-add first song to list, 
		[DONE] Need to add form to config snap to grid
		[DONE] Need to integrate appsettings::thirdguidenabled to mygraphicscene
		[DONE] Test NOT specialcasing filltype now that we've added the Q_ENUMS macro
		[DONE] Group together add item commands in an undo group
				Moved the slide->addItem() call in MyGraphicsScene to after the basic name/id prop sets
		[DONE] Need to implement song editor
		[DONE] Look at setting char format thru cursor and using text document to render
		[DONE] In video content/bg: dont reject image if m_still is set UNLESS also has m_size>0 already
		[REJECTED] Need to change double click on song list to send straight to live
		[REJECTED] Add editing to slide group/slide model lists in the list itself (e.g. to change slide/group title)
		[LATER] Audio with videos
				Update QVideo to use QAudioOutput in qtmultimedia tree to play audio in video files
		[LATER] Per-verse custom slides - key to header OR passage#
		[LATER] Master overlay - add "disable master overlay" to slide group option box
		[LATER] Script plugin item
		[LATER] In-flight edits
				need to add specific framework for this
				this could be done by cloning the slidegroup when set on the Live slidegroupviewer
				then when the slide is edited, press "F5" or whatever to send to viewer again
				however, the reason to have a "special key" to update viewer instead of live update (like PPT) in my mind was mainly for text items - so people dont see each keystroke on live output. 
				However, since text is edited in editor dialog THEN updated as a visually atomic transaction, a live-link between the editor is okay.
				However, remote dviz viewers will have to hook into the slideeditor window's closed() signal to send an updated slide group to the remote viewer OR listen for changes to props and send those changes over the wire
		[LATER] Crossfading slides with identical content seems to "dim" just slightly for a moment
				caused by fact that each items opacity fades individually on the scene so the bg "shows thru" the text until fully opaqe while crossfading
				possible fix: seperate fade roots for background content vs non-background content
				putting off for now inorder to get this release out the door
				this is more an asthetic preference right now - and an important one, but not a showstopper. More of an improvment I guess.
		[LATER] When searching for song and shift+enter, add song and  GO LIVE
				shift+enter will take a bit of work - would have to subclass QLineEdit and override keypressevent
		[LATER] Video Capture (started impl, but again, performance is terrible. That may be due to the FormatOpts specified, or in ffmpeg, or the capture hardware - need to trace - later!)
	
	- Bugs:
		clicking "no bg" in dialog doesnt clear background if it was image previously in editor
		adding slide in editor doesnt update list in live view control
		
		if edit slide, go live, the edit again, the Live Slide List View pixmap does not regenerate
		crossfading between videos of same bg (see r212 the "Dir Viz" slide - dup and then try cross fading) is hoorible performance!
			
		kbd movement needs to move all items in the selection stack

		when dragging multiple-select items, only one item syncs back to the model - the others dont
				as evidenced when the slide is live, drag multiple items, only one moves in live view
		during resize, image shadow doesnt scale
		when closing and have not saved yet, first ASK if they want to save before showing save as dialog
		When setting live from editor (and other times?) and the group changes, need to change selected group in document list model
			
		items modified in editor dont correctly "start out" in lvie view or icons
				see photos, blue box
				seems to be the changes dont always get synced back to model item (position, size)
				now it updates live when editing, but goint to diff slide then going back - starts at old position
		qt4.6b-win32: Adding a new video item or changing filename of existing item causes program crash
		[NEED CONFIRMED] qt4.6b-win32: chaing document aspect ratio doesnt affect slide editor until program restart
				should be fixed thanks to changes made below .. i think
				
		using toolbar, set font size to 1pt, zoom in so text is in view (blob of black), and then press "up size" btn - segfault
		close all open editors on closing mainwindow
		Rotating a boxcontent causes very wierd pen width scaling issues in previews
		Need better method of managing song regexps - right now the filters exist in the pixmap generation routines, the editor window, and the slide group!!
		Perfomance of the document pixmap model generator becomes a problem with a lot of songs - need to investigate - possibly use different cache key
		
		[CONFIRMED EDGE CASE] On windows, when setting video item live, it doesnt play unless you dbl-click the slide again
				other fixes (below) may have fixed this - need to confirm
				CONFIRM still broken on the .mpg video as of rev211 - test.xml, first group, third slide
					first two slides play videos fine (.mov) (slides auto change on timer)
					but when the third slide playes (data/s..loop..3.mpg), it doesnt start video first time around 
					video plays fine when group loops back through
					this only happens FIRST time, and only righ after program launch
					even opening/closing test.xml and reopening doesnt reproduce - video playes fine
				
		[ON HOLD] If blank document "<document/>", crash when add group then click group
				doesnt crash any more, but qpainter reports all sorts of errors on console when trying to render the icon and the group never goes live
				this would be considered a corrupt file and right now I dont have a gracious way of detecting this
				however, we must handle corrupt files to some extent
					preferably, detect the file is corrupt and refuse to load 
					
		[FIXED] new items STILL not going on top
				need probably to check z vals of fade roots
				redesigned the new item algorithims in mygraphicscene to only add to slide and let the sig/slot events add to the scene
		[FIXED] going live with a song takes too long - need to make < .25 second
				or a slide - both take a while
				large song (Amazing grace - praise song) takes > 3 - 5 seconds
				time seems to be in the pixmap generation - need better caching
				for songs: cached generated pixmaps based on passage text and disabled the call to the parent generate pixmap in SlideGroupListModel 
		[FIXED] large image items (original file size) makes image items take long time to repaint, which reduces responsiveness of UI
				for Editor, maybe scale image down at time of load and only repaint that, rather than scale on every repaint
				or scale once when contents rect changes
				had to do with loading times when model item changed
					had to cache the loaded pixmap, NOT the scaled pixmap
		[FIXED] win32: File->New crashes
				probably fixed, need to verify 
				Nope! Still need work.
				Crashes even with non-live items
				Confirmed that it "new" works on linux tho - need to debug on windows then - drats
				confirmed it still "doesnt work" as of 10-16
					freezes program
				confirmed it DOES work as of 10-16 on *linux*
				should work now with code changes (releaseDocument() method added)
				it works now! 10-17-09
		[FIXED] Open file crashes
				crashes on both win32 and linux
				should work now with code changes (releaseDocument() method added)
				it works now! 10-17-09
		[FIXED] = Show Stoppers =
			[FIXED] file open crashing
				fixed crashing
			[FIXED] now opening multislide file only show first group
				had to call begin/end remove rows in the model
			[FIXED] file new crashing
				possibly related to the other crashing of file->open - added releaseDocument() to doc list model
				works - 10-17-09
			[FIXED] file open doesnt adjust AR in editor correctly
			[FIXED] jpeg problems on windows
				check if building in debug or release mode
				not sure what was the problem - jpegs work fine in windows
				large (>1MB) jpegs take a while to render (>.1 sec) due to time it takes to scale
				see bug report above - need to optimize rendering, cache scaled versions
		[FIXED] if you start a group live that has an timer on it, and switch groups to another one without pausing the timer, segfault when first timer expires
				not sure why, the timer is stopped but it still fires! Reported on qt-interest at 2009-10-16 17:08 - we'll see what response we get
				suggestion made to use internal locking variable - will try
				had to delete the original view control when chaging factories
		[REJECTED] when zooming in on text using mouse wheel, it doesn't re-render for new scale  
				due to live performance that the caching improves, I'm not going to "fix" this right now
		[FIXED] Text editor in slide still white sometimes
				made it so modified text in box content doesnt ever sync to model item
				text config box sets text on model item instead and sync up
		[FIXED] when adding new item, set selected
		[FIXED] boxcontent should not offset by pen width
		[FIXED] svg needs to scale as contents rect is resized
		[FIXED] when fading betwen verses in songs, takes too long to render blurred shadows - need to default song shadows to 0 radius or make faster rendering (pre-render?)
				tuned the render cache (an edge case was introduced last night causing slide text to clear the cache every time the delegate was re-created)
				performance could still be better, but it seems acceptable for now
		[FIXED] video still randomly pausing when switching slides in editor or going live
				Adjusted SlideGroupViewer's video provider handling, adjusted the order of play/setpixmap calls in background content and video file content
		[FIXED] adding items to slides doesnt put them on top (need to check on z order)
				for some reason, the m_content array in MyGraphicsScene was showing empty(), so I used the QGraphicsScene::items() method to get list of items for zvalue cals instead
		[FIXED] Backgrounds in per-verse slides dont work consistently (sometimes override, sometimes master shows thru)
				I think its because both BackgroundContent items (from master and child) are added to final slide 
				need to remove master bg if one in child
				could not preproduce on linux, but I applied the assumed fix anyway - remove master bg if child slide has a bg
		[FIXED] Visual item's QColor toxml routines dont save alpha channel!
				modified routines in AbstractVisualItem to save qcolor as a explicit csv-list of rgba values instead of a uint-cast .rgba() value
		[FIXED] Undo/redo of shadow enabled on text box doesn't seem to work
				typo of the property name - fixed the Q_PROPERTY's property name and its all good now
		[FIXED] F2 with no slidegroup selected in main screen - segfault
				Checked idx.isValid() in actionEditGroup() and actionDelGroup()
		[FIXED] Add slide, add box, delete slide, undo delete slide, move box - segfault
				not sure exactly what fixed it - I really dont. Somewhere in the last 2 svn revs it was fixed.
		[FIXED] Adding an item to an slide that was removed then readded causes segfault
				not sure exactly what fixed it - I really dont. Somewhere in the last 2 svn revs it was fixed.
		[FIXED] Undoing "del slide" causes segfault (e.g. trying to re-add slide using undo after deleing the slide)
				slideeditorwindow was doing 'delete slide' at end of the slot that removed the slide
				moved the delete slide to the destructor of UndoSlideRemoved action
		[FIXED] Undo "add slide" removes the wrong slide!
				logic error - I gave the wrong slide to the UndoSlideAdded action
		[FIXED] Undo item add never removes the item (goes back to add item, just doesnt remove it)
				for some reason, we have to call m_window->scene()->removeVisualDelegate() explicitly in the UndoSlideItemAdded::undo() handler
		[FIXED] Undo of item removal doesn't work corectly
				undo item removal works now - just swapped method calls around in the command
		[FIXED] Undo/redo of change fill type doesn't work - probably need to cast to/from int
				had to special-case the fillType field in the UndoSlideItemChanged command
				seems QObject::setProperty() never called the property writer for fillType, my guess is because fillType is a custom enum
				Fixed: had to call Q_ENUMS(FillType) after the Q_PROPERTY declerations - now I don't need to special case filltype - yay!
		[FIXED] "Lower" btn in config doesnt propegate to live view
				due to not syncing to model in the qgraphicsitem propchanged event, zvalue wasnt being sent to model
				changed MyGraphicsScene (which handles the z value changing) to update content->modelItem(), which would then propogate to the visual
		[FIXED] Need to ignore height of song textbox in template
				Fixed underlying problem - Compensated by enlarging textbox if needed, but not shrinking textbox
		[FIXED] Editing text doesnt update slide editor slide until close editor and reopen
				had to delete cached rendered text pixmap (delete m_text and update graphics, regenerating cached pixmap)
		[FIXED] In SongGroup, define "first textbox" by z value - current def is too arbitrary (relies on order of items added)
		[FIXED] In item config dialog, video "play" button does nothing - hide for later revs
		[FIXED] Starting new results in incorrect AR for "new" doc - doc should adopt current live AR
				Added liveAspectRatio method to app settings and routines to search outputs by tag
		[FIXED] When starting with no document (test.xml), closing program results in "cannot write to ''" (should prompt to save as)
				Do saveFile in closeEvent, check for empty filename, prompt saveas, if cancel saveas, then dont accept close event
		[FIXED] File->New with item on live output item crashes dviz
				the releasegroup method caused currentChanged signal, which caused the view control to try to change slides while group was being released
				just added bool lock flag so when releasegroup was called, the signal that listened for currentchanged would ignore signals
		[FIXED] Document list icons need to be lot smaller
				Changed initial icon size in DocumentListModel from 192 to 48
		[FIXED] Shadow option has no effect on box object - either remove tab or enable shaodw
				enabled basic shadow rendering - no gausian blur yet
		[FIXED] Turning on/off line has no effect on box 
		[FIXED] Turning on/off bg has no effect on box
				made BoxContent honor fillEnabled/outlineEnabled flags
		[FIXED] Changing AR doesn't resize background elements of slides in document - probably should automatically
				updated BackGround content to listen for a 'sceneRectChanged()' signal from MyGraphicsScene
		[FIXED] text config box text is white - maybe need to get html from model item for editing??
				adjusted textconfig dialog to load/save text to model and rely on sync signals to load text to visual delegate
		[FIXED] Song cross fade / go live performance is terrible
				converted text layout to use Qt's QTextDocument after learning how to set text output pen
		[HACK-FIX] Slide editor -> new slide doesnt show slide in list model again!
				hacked by doing a calling m_editWin->setSlideGroup(group); before AND after showing the edit window - doesnt seem right, but it works
		[FIXED] When go live, auto select the current live slide
				simple code change to set currentIndex
		[WORKSFORME] Slide in icon preview for slide group isnt always the first slide
				not sure where I saw this, but can't repeat
		[FIXED] When changing output size with custom output, output disappers until program restart
				simply called setVisible on outputs after closing the output dialog
		[FIXED] When using 1.6AR, content locations centered in slide editor appear off center in preview and live (but correct in icons)
				it was actually the slideditor window that was wrong (and the live view) because both were created before the document was loaded
		[FIXED] Somtimes going live with video item it doesnt play
				had to do with QVideoProvider's internal play/pause counter
		[FIXED] When setting video in slide editor, it never shows first frame
				had to do with QVideoProvider's internal play/pause counter
		[FIXED] Video slides crashing when made live on Win32
		[FIXED] When changing AR, reload document (or recreate slides)
		[FIXED] Songs need to be vertically centered as well
		[FIXED] Cross fading text with shadows shows ugly "dark" text during crossfade - need to investigate clipping shadow to only visible part of painter path
		[FIXED] When dbl click on a FILTERED song list, the song clicked comes from the UNFILTERED list (e.g. its not the song clicked)
		[FIXED] Major problems with song list display
		[FIXED] Song Text not being layed out properly with the "center" functionality (text being clipped, etc) - Can't use <br> tags I fond out.
		[HACK-FIX] Song slide preview has lines that are "too thick"
		[FIXED] Song text on output is too far to the top-left (but preview is fine) - aspect ratio was set wrong and had to adjustViewScaling when chaged
		[FIXED] Need to set item name in slide generator for songs
		[FIXED] Need to set item id in slide generator
		[FIXED] Songs aren't being converted toXml properly (is toXml virtual??)
				needed to match the function signatures exactly - in this case, toXml was missing the 'const' from the original defn
		[FIXED] When another slide live first, then trans to video slide, single click (preview) different slide, the live item stops playing
		[FIXED] Centered TextBox items appear too far to the left in icon previews (list models, etc)
		[FIXED] Setting config on background item causes it to "go away" until program reload
		[FIXED] Output Dialog should have all tabs on left disabled until output selected, otherwise SIGSEGV if user clicks screen list before selecting output
		[FIXED] new slide button stopped working
		[WORKSFORME] slide editor crash when add box then delete box
		[FIXED] slide listbox cant scroll down below the fold
		[WORKSFORME] figure out why some items (VideoFileContent for now) jumps position vertically when slide changes
		[FIXED] figure out why mirror item doesnt get repainted when slide changed back
		[FIXED] turn off multi-select unless intentional - looks like if one item selected, then right-click on another item, it selects both items
		[FIXED] repaint bug -see textitem - when textobx selected and hover over other content, bg in text box turns white...why?
		[FIXED] (r86) -since textbox clipping has been turned on, need to keep all text inside content rect - add margin or something to layout - see letter "L" in tahoma at start of a box
