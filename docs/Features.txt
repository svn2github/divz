Revised Task list for Release 1.0, 10/10/09:
	----------------------------
	"Tasty Breakfast" Release
	----------------------------
	Target Use Cases: 
	Songs, Announcements, Sermon
	----------------------------
	
	- Models:
		[DONE] - Song Database Model
			[DONE] - SQLite Backend 
	- Logic:
		[STARTED] - Translator/Slide Generator
			- Given a Song, translate into a slide group
	- UI:
		- List of forms needed:
			- "Grid and Guidelines" Form
			- Slide Group settings (aspect ratio, etc)
			- Song Editor
		- SongDatabase List View
			- Three columns:
				- Title, #, Tags (Chorus, Hymn, etc)
		- Search Function:
			- Default to Full Text, Sort by Title
			- Title
			- Name
			- Full Text
		[BARELY STARTED] - Random access viewer control
			- Just do it
			- Should be "smart" - for songs, render differently than generic slide groups
			- Go by Group Type?
			- Think about custom foldback generator - this is just a custom viewer control generator needed
		- In-flight edits
	- Visuals:
		[DONE] - Add Aspect Ratio setting
		[DONE] - Text Centering in a Text Box
		- Undo/redo framework
			- Must have this for sermons and announcment slides
		- Copy/paste or duplicate slides
		[BARELY STARTED] - Snap to grid support
		[BARELY STARTED] - Increse/decrease size of font from toolbar - needed for sermon/announcment
		- Layout asissts - center objects vert/horz
		- Image Item
			- Should be easy
			- If we have time, add crop handles
		[ALMOST] - Cross Fade on Changing Slide
			[DONE] - Important Point:
				[DONE] - Need to abstract video source/decoder to a "singleton" 
				[DONE] - Once source/decoder for that file per program
			- When slide*Group* is set on scene, need to scan and initalize decoders for all videos, but STOP at first frame
			- When cross fade starts, start playing
			- Stop playing prev slide when cross fade ends
		[DONE] - Shadows (Text):
			- Can settle for simple block shadow
			- Gausian blur if we have time 
		[STARTED] - Backgrounds:
			- Add background item type & Position automatically, Disable movement
			- Still cant set item color/props with config box
		- SVG Item if we have time
		[STARTED] - Gradients - can settle for making gradients in gimp and import as photo, but need to eventually have support direclty in dviz
	- Improvements:
		Consider moving opengl option to a per-output setting
		Consider making Output objects QObjects that can emit signals when changed
	- Bugs:
		[FIXED] Centered TextBox items appear too far to the left in icon previews (list models, etc)
		[FIXED] Setting config on background item causes it to "go away" until program reload
		[FIXED] Output Dialog should have all tabs on left disabled until output selected, otherwise SIGSEGV if user clicks screen list before selecting output

		[FIXED] -new slide button stopped working
		[WORKSFORME] -slide editor crash when add box then delete box
		[FIXED] -slide listbox cant scroll down below the fold
		[WORKSFORME] -figure out why some items (VideoFileContent for now) jumps position vertically when slide changes
		[FIXED] -figure out why mirror item doesnt get repainted when slide changed back
		[FIXED] -turn off multi-select unless intentional - looks like if one item selected, then right-click on another item, it selects both items
		[FIXED] -repaint bug -see textitem - when textobx selected and hover over other content, bg in text box turns white...why?
		[FIXED] (r86) -since textbox clipping has been turned on, need to keep all text inside content rect - add margin or something to layout - see letter "L" in tahoma at start of a box
