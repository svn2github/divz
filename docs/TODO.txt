-slide editor crash when add box then delete box

-undo/redo framework
	- see tools/undoframework, esp diagramscene mouse events
	- dont merge move commands
	- use the mousepress / clearselected to fix the "turn off multiselect" item, below
	
-slide listbox cant scroll down below the fold
[DONE] (just cleared all pixmaps) -deleting a slide doesnt clear it's pixmap cached icon in the listmodel
-add ability to increase/decrease font size of a textbox from the toolbar rather than having to open the properties dialog

-figure out why some items (VideoFileContent for now) jumps position vertically when slide changes
-figure out why mirror item doesnt get repainted when slide changed back
-turn off multi-select unless intentional - looks like if one item selected, then right-click on another item, it selects both items
-repaint bug -see textitem - when textobx selected and hover over other content, bg in text box turns white...why?
-make videofileitem store framegrab of last/recent frame as icon or for rendering till video loaded
	- cache on disk somewhere semi-perm

-since textbox clipping has been turned on, need to keep all text inside content rect - add margin or something to layout - see letter "L" in tahoma at start of a box

[DONE] -implement slide "snapshot" views in list

-midway resize handles (e.g. centerpoint at top and bottom, left/right for one-axis resize)
-generic shadow renderer item (look at mirror item)
-mirror item offset and size options

-video frame grab for first frame
-video "pause" icons on item
-video trim (set A/B points)

-image/video crop handle mode

-text wrap centering

-copy/paste items


[DONE] -relative path for VideoFiles (or any resources for that matter...) ** done 

-improve performance for looped video items - maybe cache frames so the loop doesnt have to re-decode?
	-add flag for video item to either loop or once thru

-add SVG item (just draws an svg item, scalable)
	- optional itemid
	
-items to add:
	-line item (straight line)
	-photo
	-svg
	-live video
